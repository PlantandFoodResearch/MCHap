  --bam BAM [BAM ...]   Bam file(s) to use in analysis. This may be (1) a list
                        of one or more bam filepaths, (2) a plain-text file
                        containing a single bam filepath on each line, (3) a
                        plain-text file containing a sample identifier and its
                        corresponding bam filepath on each line separated by a
                        tab. If options (1) or (2) are used then all samples
                        within each bam will be used within the analysis. If
                        option (3) is used then only the specified sample will
                        be extracted from each bam file and An error will be
                        raised if a sample is not found within its specified
                        bam file.
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Specify sample ploidy (default = 2).This may be (1) a
                        single integer used to specify the ploidy of all
                        samples or (2) a file containing a list of all samples
                        and their ploidy. If option (2) is used then each line
                        of the plaintext file must contain a single sample
                        identifier and the ploidy of that sample separated by
                        a tab.
  --sample-pool SAMPLE_POOL
                        WARNING: this is an experimental feature!!! Pool
                        samples together into a single genotype. This may be
                        (1) the name of a single pool for all samples or (2) a
                        file containing a list of all samples and their
                        assigned pool. If option (2) is used then each line of
                        the plaintext file must contain a single sample
                        identifier and the name of a pool separated by a
                        tab.Samples may be assigned to multiple pools by using
                        the same sample name on multiple lines.Each pool will
                        treated as a single genotype by combining all reads
                        from its constituent samples. Note that the pool names
                        should be used in place of the samples names when
                        assigning other per-sample parameters such as ploidy
                        or inbreeding coefficients.
  --prior-frequencies PRIOR_FREQUENCIES
                        Optionally specify an INFO field within the input VCF
                        file to designate as prior allele frequencies for the
                        input haplotypes. This can be any numerical field of
                        length 'R' and these values will automatically be
                        normalized.
  --sample-parents SAMPLE_PARENTS
                        A file containing a list of samples and their parents
                        used to indicate pedigree structure. Each line should
                        contain a sample identifier followed by both parent
                        identifiers separated by tabs. A period '.' is used to
                        indicate unknown parents.
  --gamete-ploidy GAMETE_PLOIDY
                        Ploidy of the gametes contributing to each sample. By
                        default it is assumed that the ploidy of each gamete
                        is equal to half the ploidy of the sample derived from
                        that gamete. If all gametes have the same ploidy then
                        a single number can be specified. If gametic ploidy is
                        variable then these values must be specified with a
                        file containing a list of samples and the ploidy of
                        the gametes they were derived from. Each line of this
                        file should contain a sample identifier followed by
                        the ploidy of gametes derived from each parent in the
                        same order as specified using the --sample-parents
                        argument. For each sample, the ploidy of the two
                        gametes must sum to the ploidy of that sample.
  --gamete-ibd GAMETE_IBD
                        Excess IBD/homozygosity due to meiotic processes. By
                        default this variable is 0.0 for all gametes and non-
                        zero values may only be specified for gametes with a
                        ploidy of 2. This value must be in the interval [0, 1]
                        with a value of 0.0 indicating no excess
                        ibd/homozygosity and a value of 1.0 indicating that
                        the gamete must be fully homozygous.If a single value
                        is specified then this will be applied to all gametes.
                        If this value varies between gametes then it must be
                        specified with a file containing a list of samples and
                        the value associated with each gamete those samples
                        are derived from. Each line should contain a sample
                        identifier followed by value of each gamete in the
                        same order as specified using the --sample-parents
                        argument.
  --gamete-error GAMETE_ERROR
                        An error term associated with each parent-child pair
                        indicating the probability that that gamete was not
                        derived from the specified parent. By default this
                        variable is 0.01 for all parent-child pairs. This
                        value must be in the interval [0, 1] and should
                        generally be > 0 and < 1.If a single value is
                        specified then this will be applied to all parent-
                        child pairs. If this value varies between gametes then
                        it must be specified with a file containing a list of
                        samples and the value associated with each gamete
                        those samples are derived from. Each line should
                        contain a sample identifier followed by value of each
                        gamete in the same order as specified using the
                        --sample-parents argument.

                        Optionally filter input haplotypes using a string of
                        the form '<field><operator><value>' where <field> is a
                        numerical INFO field with length 'A' or 'R',
                        <operator> is one of =|>|<|>=|<=|!=, and <value> is a
                        numerical value.
  --base-error-rate BASE_ERROR_RATE
                        Expected base error rate of read sequences (default =
                        0.0024). The default value comes from Pfeiffer et al
                        2018 and is a general estimate for Illumina short
                        reads.
  --use-base-phred-scores
                        Flag: use base phred-scores as a source of base error
                        rate. This will use the phred-encoded per base scores
                        in addition to the general error rate specified by the
                        --base-error-rate argument. Using this option can slow
                        down assembly speed.

                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-qcfail-reads   Flag: Use reads marked as qcfail in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).

                        Flag: Use reads marked as supplementary in the
                        assembly (these are skipped by default).
