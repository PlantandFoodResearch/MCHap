optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --region REGION       Specify a single target region with the format
                        contig:start-stop. This region will be a single
                        variant in the output VCF. This argument can not be
                        combined with the --targets argument.
  --region-id REGION_ID
                        Specify an identifier for the locus specified with the
                        --region argument. This id will be reported in the
                        output VCF.
  --targets TARGETS     Bed file containing multiple genomic intervals for
                        haplotype assembly. First three columns (contig,
                        start, stop) are mandatory. If present, the fourth
                        column (id) will be used as the variant id in the
                        output VCF.This argument can not be combined with the
                        --region argument.
  --variants VARIANTS   Tabix indexed VCF file containing SNP variants to be
                        used in assembly. Assembled haplotypes will only
                        contain the reference and alternate alleles specified
                        within this file.
  --reference REFERENCE
                        Indexed fasta file containing the reference genome.
  --bam [BAM [BAM ...]]
                        A list of 0 or more bam files. Haplotypes will be
                        assembled for all samples found within all listed bam
                        files unless the --sample-list parameter is used.
  --bam-list BAM_LIST   A file containing a list of bam file paths (one per
                        line). This can optionally be used in place of or
                        combined with the --bam parameter.
  --sample-bam SAMPLE_BAM
                        A file containing a list of samples with bam file
                        paths. This can optionally be used in place the --bam
                        and --bam-list parameters. This is faster than using
                        those parameters when running many small jobs.
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Default ploidy for all samples (default = 2). This
                        value is used for all samples which are not specified
                        using the --sample-ploidy parameter
  --sample-ploidy SAMPLE_PLOIDY
                        A file containing a list of samples with a ploidy
                        value used to indicate where their ploidy differs from
                        the default value. Each line should contain a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then an integer
                        ploidy value.
  --sample-list SAMPLE_LIST
                        Optionally specify a file containing a list of samples
                        to haplotype (one sample id per line). This file also
                        specifies the sample order in the output. If not
                        specified, all samples in the input bam files will be
                        haplotyped.
  --inbreeding INBREEDING
                        Default inbreeding coefficient for all samples
                        (default = 0.0). This value is used for all samples
                        which are not specified using the --sample-inbreeding
                        parameter.
  --sample-inbreeding SAMPLE_INBREEDING
                        A file containing a list of samples with an inbreeding
                        coefficient used to indicate where their expected
                        inbreeding coefficient default value. Each line should
                        contain a sample identifier followed by a tab and then
                        a inbreeding coefficient value within the interval [0,
                        1].
  --base-error-rate BASE_ERROR_RATE
                        Expected base error rate of read sequences (default =
                        0.0). This is used in addition to base phred-scores by
                        default however base phred-scores can be ignored using
                        the --ignore-base-phred-scores flag.
  --ignore-base-phred-scores
                        Flag: Ignore base phred-scores as a source of base
                        error rate. This can improve MCMC speed by allowing
                        for greater de-duplication of reads however an error
                        rate > 0.0 must be specified with the --base-error-
                        rate argument.
  --haplotype-posterior-threshold HAPLOTYPE_POSTERIOR_THRESHOLD
                        Posterior probability required for a haplotype to be
                        included in the output VCF as an alternative allele.
                        The posterior probability of each haplotype is
                        assessed per individual and calculated as the
                        probability of that haplotype being present with one
                        or more copies in that individual.A haplotype is
                        included as an alternate allele if it meets this
                        posterior probability threshold in at least one
                        individual. This parameter is the main mechanism to
                        control the number of alternate alleles in ech VCF
                        record and hence the number of genotypes assessed when
                        recalculating likelihoods and posterior distributions
                        (default = 0.20).
  --use-assembly-posteriors
                        Flag: Use posterior probabilities from each
                        individuals assembly rather than recomputing
                        posteriors based on the observed alleles across all
                        samples. These posterior probabilities will be used to
                        call genotypes , metrics related to the genotype, and
                        the posterior distribution (GP field) if specified.
                        This may lead to less robust genotype calls in the
                        presence of multi-modality and hence it is recommended
                        to run the simulation for longer or using parallel-
                        tempering when using this option. This option may be
                        more suitable than the default when calling haplotypes
                        in unrelated individuals.
  --genotype-likelihoods
                        Flag: Report genotype likelihoods in the GL VCF field.
  --genotype-posteriors
                        Flag: Report genotype posterior probabilities in the
                        GP VCF field.
  --mapping-quality MAPPING_QUALITY
                        Minimum mapping quality of reads used in assembly
                        (default = 20).
  --keep-duplicate-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as duplicates in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-qcfail-reads   Flag: Use reads marked as qcfail in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-supplementary-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as supplementary in the
                        assembly (these are skipped by default).
  --mcmc-chains MCMC_CHAINS
                        Number of independent MCMC chains per assembly
                        (default = 2).
  --mcmc-temperatures [MCMC_TEMPERATURES [MCMC_TEMPERATURES ...]]
                        A list of inverse-temperatures to use for parallel
                        tempered chains. These values must be between 0 and 1
                        and will automatically be sorted in ascending order.
                        The cold chain value of 1.0 will be added
                        automatically if it is not specified.
  --mcmc-steps MCMC_STEPS
                        Number of steps to simulate in each MCMC chain
                        (default = 1500).
  --mcmc-burn MCMC_BURN
                        Number of initial steps to discard from each MCMC
                        chain (default = 500).
  --mcmc-fix-homozygous MCMC_FIX_HOMOZYGOUS
                        Fix alleles that are homozygous with a probability
                        greater than or equal to the specified value (default
                        = 0.999). The probability of that a variant is
                        homozygous in a sample is assessed independently for
                        each variant prior to MCMC simulation. If an allele is
                        "fixed" it is not allowed vary within the MCMC thereby
                        reducing computational complexity.
  --mcmc-seed MCMC_SEED
                        Random seed for MCMC (default = 42).
  --mcmc-recombination-step-probability MCMC_RECOMBINATION_STEP_PROBABILITY
                        Probability of performing a recombination sub-step
                        during each step of the MCMC. (default = 0.5).
  --mcmc-partial-dosage-step-probability MCMC_PARTIAL_DOSAGE_STEP_PROBABILITY
                        Probability of performing a within-interval dosage
                        sub-step during each step of the MCMC. (default =
                        0.5).

                        Probability of performing a dosage sub-step during
                        each step of the MCMC. (default = 1.0).
  --mcmc-chain-incongruence-threshold MCMC_CHAIN_INCONGRUENCE_THRESHOLD
                        Posterior phenotype probability threshold for
                        identification of incongruent posterior modes (default
