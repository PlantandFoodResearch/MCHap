optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --region REGION       Specify a single target region with the format
                        contig:start-stop. This region will be a single
                        variant in the output VCF. This argument can not be
                        combined with the --targets argument.
  --region-id REGION_ID
                        Specify an identifier for the locus specified with the
                        --region argument. This id will be reported in the
                        output VCF.
  --targets TARGETS     Bed file containing multiple genomic intervals for
                        haplotype assembly. First three columns (contig,
                        start, stop) are mandatory. If present, the fourth
                        column (id) will be used as the variant id in the
                        output VCF.This argument can not be combined with the
                        --region argument.
  --variants VARIANTS   Tabix indexed VCF file containing SNP variants to be
                        used in assembly. Assembled haplotypes will only
                        contain the reference and alternate alleles specified
                        within this file.
  --reference REFERENCE
                        Indexed fasta file containing the reference genome.
  --bam [BAM ...]       A list of 0 or more bam files. All samples found
                        within the listed bam files will be genotypes unless
                        the --sample-list parameter is used.
  --bam-list BAM_LIST   A file containing a list of bam file paths (one per
                        line). This can optionally be used in place of or
                        combined with the --bam parameter.
  --sample-bam SAMPLE_BAM
                        A file containing a list of samples with bam file
                        paths. Each line of the file should be a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then a bam file path.
                        This can optionally be used in place the --bam and
                        --bam-list parameters. This is faster than using those
                        parameters when running many small jobs. An error will
                        be thrown if a sample is not found within its
                        specified bam file.
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Default ploidy for all samples (default = 2). This
                        value is used for all samples which are not specified
                        using the --sample-ploidy parameter
  --sample-ploidy SAMPLE_PLOIDY
                        A file containing a list of samples with a ploidy
                        value used to indicate where their ploidy differs from
                        the default value. Each line should contain a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then an integer
                        ploidy value.
  --inbreeding INBREEDING
                        Default inbreeding coefficient for all samples
                        (default = 0.0). This value is used for all samples
                        which are not specified using the --sample-inbreeding
                        parameter.
  --sample-inbreeding SAMPLE_INBREEDING
                        A file containing a list of samples with an inbreeding
                        coefficient used to indicate where their expected
                        inbreeding coefficient default value. Each line should
                        contain a sample identifier followed by a tab and then
                        a inbreeding coefficient value within the interval [0,
                        1].
  --base-error-rate BASE_ERROR_RATE
                        Expected base error rate of read sequences (default =
                        0.0024). The default value comes from Pfeiffer et al
                        2018 and is a general estimate for Illumina short
                        reads.
  --use-base-phred-scores
                        Flag: use base phred-scores as a source of base error
                        rate. This will use the phred-encoded per base scores
                        in addition to the general error rate specified by the
                        --base-error-rate argument. Using this option can slow
                        down assembly speed.
  --mapping-quality MAPPING_QUALITY
                        Minimum mapping quality of reads used in assembly
                        (default = 20).
  --keep-duplicate-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as duplicates in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-qcfail-reads   Flag: Use reads marked as qcfail in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-supplementary-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as supplementary in the
                        assembly (these are skipped by default).
  --read-group-field READ_GROUP_FIELD
                        Read group field to use as sample id (default = "SM").
                        The chosen field determines tha sample ids required in
                        other input files e.g. the --sample-list argument.
  --report [REPORT ...]
                        Extra fields to report within the output VCF: GP =
                        genotype posterior probabilities; GL = genotype
                        likelihoods; AFP = posterior mean allele frequencies.
  --cores CORES         Number of cpu cores to use (default = 1).
  --mcmc-chains MCMC_CHAINS
                        Number of independent MCMC chains per assembly
                        (default = 2).
  --mcmc-steps MCMC_STEPS
                        Number of steps to simulate in each MCMC chain
                        (default = 1500).
  --mcmc-burn MCMC_BURN
                        Number of initial steps to discard from each MCMC
                        chain (default = 500).
  --mcmc-seed MCMC_SEED
                        Random seed for MCMC (default = 42).
  --mcmc-chain-incongruence-threshold MCMC_CHAIN_INCONGRUENCE_THRESHOLD
                        Posterior phenotype probability threshold for
                        identification of incongruent posterior modes (default
                        = 0.60).
  --mcmc-fix-homozygous MCMC_FIX_HOMOZYGOUS
                        Fix alleles that are homozygous with a probability
                        greater than or equal to the specified value (default
                        = 0.999). The probability of that a variant is
                        homozygous in a sample is assessed independently for
                        each variant prior to MCMC simulation. If an allele is
                        "fixed" it is not allowed vary within the MCMC thereby
                        reducing computational complexity.
  --mcmc-llk-cache-threshold MCMC_LLK_CACHE_THRESHOLD
                        Threshold for determining whether to cache log-
                        likelihoods during MCMC to improve performance. This
                        value is computed as ploidy * variants * unique-reads
                        (default = 100). If set to 0 then log-likelihoods will
                        be cached for all samples including those with few
                        observed reads which is inefficient and can slow the
                        MCMC. If set to -1 then log-likelihood caching will be
                        disabled for all samples.
  --mcmc-recombination-step-probability MCMC_RECOMBINATION_STEP_PROBABILITY
                        Probability of performing a recombination sub-step
                        during each step of the MCMC. (default = 0.5).
  --mcmc-dosage-step-probability MCMC_DOSAGE_STEP_PROBABILITY
                        Probability of performing a dosage sub-step during
                        each step of the MCMC. (default = 1.0).
  --mcmc-partial-dosage-step-probability MCMC_PARTIAL_DOSAGE_STEP_PROBABILITY
                        Probability of performing a within-interval dosage
                        sub-step during each step of the MCMC. (default =
                        0.5).
  --mcmc-temperatures [MCMC_TEMPERATURES ...]
                        A list of inverse-temperatures to use for parallel
                        tempered chains. These values must be between 0 and 1
                        and will automatically be sorted in ascending order.
                        The cold chain value of 1.0 will be added
                        automatically if it is not specified.
  --sample-mcmc-temperatures SAMPLE_MCMC_TEMPERATURES
                        A file containing a list of samples with mcmc
                        (inverse) temperatures. Each line of the file should
                        start with a sample identifier followed by tab
                        seperated numeric values between 0 and 1. The number
                        of temperatures specified may vary between samples.
                        Samples not listed in this file will use the default
                        values specified with the --mcmc-temperatures
                        argument.
  --haplotype-posterior-threshold HAPLOTYPE_POSTERIOR_THRESHOLD
                        Posterior probability required for a haplotype to be
                        included in the output VCF as an alternative allele.
                        The posterior probability of each haplotype is
                        assessed per individual and calculated as the
                        probability of that haplotype being present with one
                        or more copies in that individual.A haplotype is
                        included as an alternate allele if it meets this
                        posterior probability threshold in at least one
                        individual. This parameter is the main mechanism to
                        control the number of alternate alleles in ech VCF
                        record and hence the number of genotypes assessed when
                        recalculating likelihoods and posterior distributions
                        (default = 0.20).
