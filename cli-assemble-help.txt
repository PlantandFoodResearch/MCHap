optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --targets TARGETS     Bed file containing genomic intervals for haplotype
                        assembly. First three columns (contig, start, stop)
                        are mandatory. If present, the fourth column (id) will
                        be used as the variant id in the output VCF.
  --variants VARIANTS   Tabix indexed VCF file containing SNP variants to be
                        used in assembly. Assembled haplotypes will only
                        contain the reference and alternate alleles specified
                        within this file.
  --reference REFERENCE
                        Indexed fasta file containing the reference genome.
  --bam [BAM [BAM ...]]
                        A list of 0 or more bam files. Haplotypes will be
                        assembled for all samples found within all listed bam
                        files unless the --sample-list parameter is used.
  --bam-list BAM_LIST   A file containing a list of bam file paths (one per
                        line). This can optionally be used in place of or
                        combined with the --bam parameter.
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Default ploidy for all samples (default = 2). This
                        value is used for all samples which are not specified
                        using the --sample-ploidy parameter
  --sample-ploidy SAMPLE_PLOIDY
                        A file containing a list of samples with a ploidy
                        value used to indicate where their ploidy differs from
                        the default value. Each line should contain a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then an integer
                        ploidy value.
  --sample-list SAMPLE_LIST
                        Optionally specify a file containing a list of samples
                        to haplotype (one sample id per line). This file also
                        specifies the sample order in the output. If not
                        specified, all samples in the input bam files will be
                        haplotyped.
  --inbreeding INBREEDING
                        Default inbreeding coefficient for all samples
                        (default = 0.0). This value is used for all samples
                        which are not specified using the --sample-inbreeding
                        parameter
  --sample-inbreeding SAMPLE_INBREEDING
                        A file containing a list of samples with an inbreeding
                        coefficient used to indicate where their expected
                        inbreeding coefficient default value. Each line should
                        contain a sample identifier followed by a tab and then
                        a inbreeding coefficient value within the interval [0,
                        1]
  --base-error-rate BASE_ERROR_RATE
                        Expected base error rate of read sequences (default =
                        0.0). This is used in addition to base phred-scores by
                        default however base phred-scores can be ignored using
                        the --ignore-base-phred-scores flag.
  --ignore-base-phred-scores
                        Flag: Ignore base phred-scores as a source of base
                        error rate. This can improve MCMC speed by allowing
                        for greater de-duplication of reads however an error
                        rate > 0.0 must be specified with the --base-error-
                        rate argument.
  --mapping-quality MAPPING_QUALITY
                        Minimum mapping quality of reads used in assembly
                        (default = 20).
  --keep-duplicate-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as duplicates in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-qcfail-reads   Flag: Use reads marked as qcfail in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-supplementary-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as supplementary in the
                        assembly (these are skipped by default).
  --best-genotype       Flag: allways call the best supported complete
                        genotype within a called phenotype. This may result in
                        calling genotypes with a posterior probability less
                        than --filter-probability however a phenotype
                        probability of >= --filter-probability is still
                        required.
  --call-filtered       Flag: include genotype calls for filtered samples.
                        Sample filter tags will still indicate samples that
                        have been filtered. WARNING: this can result in a
                        large VCF file with un-informative genotype calls.
  --mcmc-chains MCMC_CHAINS
                        Number of independent MCMC chains per assembly
                        (default = 2).
  --mcmc-temperatures [MCMC_TEMPERATURES [MCMC_TEMPERATURES ...]]
                        A list of inverse-temperatures to use for parallel
                        tempered chains. These values must be between 0 and 1
                        and will automatically be sorted in ascending order.
                        The cold chain value of 1.0 will be added
                        automatically if it is not specified.
  --mcmc-steps MCMC_STEPS
                        Number of steps to simulate in each MCMC chain
                        (default = 1500).
  --mcmc-burn MCMC_BURN
                        Number of initial steps to discard from each MCMC
                        chain (default = 500).
  --mcmc-fix-homozygous MCMC_FIX_HOMOZYGOUS
                        Fix alleles that are homozygous with a probability
                        greater than or equal to the specified value (default
                        = 0.999). The probability of that a variant is
                        homozygous in a sample is assessed independently for
                        each variant prior to MCMC simulation. If an allele is
                        "fixed" it is not allowed vary within the MCMC thereby
                        reducing computational complexity.
  --mcmc-seed MCMC_SEED
                        Random seed for MCMC (default = 42).
  --mcmc-recombination-step-probability MCMC_RECOMBINATION_STEP_PROBABILITY
                        Probability of performing a recombination sub-step
                        during each step of the MCMC. (default = 0.5).

                        sub-step during each step of the MCMC. (default =
                        0.5).
  --mcmc-dosage-step-probability MCMC_DOSAGE_STEP_PROBABILITY
                        Probability of performing a dosage sub-step during
                        each step of the MCMC. (default = 1.0).
  --filter-depth FILTER_DEPTH
                        Minimum sample read depth required to include an
                        assembly result (default = 5.0). Read depth is
                        measured as the mean of read depth across each
                        variable position.
  --filter-read-count FILTER_READ_COUNT
                        Minimum number of read (pairs) required within a
                        target interval in order to include an assembly result

                        unknown dosage (default = 0.95). Genotype dosage will
                        be called or partially called if it also exceeds this
                        threshold. See also the --best-genotype flag.
  --filter-kmer-k FILTER_KMER_K
                        Size of variant kmer used to filter assembly results
                        (default = 3).
  --filter-kmer FILTER_KMER
                        Minimum kmer representation required at each position
                        in assembly results (default = 0.90).
  --filter-chain-incongruence FILTER_CHAIN_INCONGRUENCE
                        Posterior phenotype probability threshold for
                        identification of incongruent posterior modes (default
                        = 0.60).
  --read-group-field READ_GROUP_FIELD
                        Read group field to use as sample id (default = "SM").
                        The chosen field determines tha sample ids required in
                        other input files e.g. the --sample-list argument.
  --cores CORES         Number of cpu cores to use (default = 1).
