optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --haplotypes HAPLOTYPES
                        Tabix indexed VCF file containing haplotype/MNP/SNP
                        variants to be re-called among input samples.
  --haplotype-frequencies HAPLOTYPE_FREQUENCIES
                        Optionally specify an INFO field within the input VCF
                        file to designate as allele frequencies for the input
                        haplotypes. This can be any numerical field of length
                        'R' and these values will automatically be normalized.
                        This parameter has no affect on the output by itself
                        but is required by some other parameters.
  --haplotype-frequencies-prior
                        Flag: Use haplotype frequencies to inform prior
                        distribution. This requires that the --haplotype-
                        frequencies parameter is also specified.
  --skip-rare-haplotypes SKIP_RARE_HAPLOTYPES
                        Optionally ignore haplotypes from the input VCF file
                        if their frequency within that file is less than the
                        specified value. This requires that the --haplotype-
                        frequencies parameter is also specified.
  --bam BAM [BAM ...]   Bam file(s) to use in analysis. This may be (1) a list
                        of one or more bam filepaths, (2) a plain-text file
                        containing a single bam filepath on each line, (3) a
                        plain-text file containing a sample identifier and its
                        corresponding bam filepath on each line separated by a
                        tab. If options (1) or (2) are used then all samples
                        within each bam will be used within the analysis. If
                        option (3) is used then only the specified sample will
                        be extracted from each bam file and An error will be
                        raised if a sample is not found within its specified
                        bam file.
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Default ploidy for all samples (default = 2). This
                        value is used for all samples which are not specified
                        using the --sample-ploidy parameter
  --sample-ploidy SAMPLE_PLOIDY
                        A file containing a list of samples with a ploidy
                        value used to indicate where their ploidy differs from
                        the default value. Each line should contain a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then an integer
                        ploidy value.
  --inbreeding INBREEDING
                        Default inbreeding coefficient for all samples
                        (default = 0.0). This value is used for all samples
                        which are not specified using the --sample-inbreeding
                        parameter.
  --sample-inbreeding SAMPLE_INBREEDING
                        A file containing a list of samples with an inbreeding
                        coefficient used to indicate where their expected
                        inbreeding coefficient default value. Each line should
                        contain a sample identifier followed by a tab and then
                        a inbreeding coefficient value within the interval [0,
                        1].
  --sample-pool SAMPLE_POOL
                        A name used to pool all sample reads into a single
                        sample. WARNING: this is an experimental feature.
  --base-error-rate BASE_ERROR_RATE
                        Expected base error rate of read sequences (default =
                        0.0024). The default value comes from Pfeiffer et al
                        2018 and is a general estimate for Illumina short
                        reads.
  --use-base-phred-scores
                        Flag: use base phred-scores as a source of base error
                        rate. This will use the phred-encoded per base scores
                        in addition to the general error rate specified by the
                        --base-error-rate argument. Using this option can slow
                        down assembly speed.
  --mapping-quality MAPPING_QUALITY
                        Minimum mapping quality of reads used in assembly
                        (default = 20).
  --keep-duplicate-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as duplicates in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-qcfail-reads   Flag: Use reads marked as qcfail in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-supplementary-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as supplementary in the
                        assembly (these are skipped by default).
  --read-group-field READ_GROUP_FIELD
                        Read group field to use as sample id (default = "SM").
                        The chosen field determines tha sample ids required in
                        other input files e.g. the --sample-list argument.
  --report [REPORT ...]
                        Extra fields to report within the output VCF: AFPRIOR
                        = prior allele frequencies; AFP = posterior mean
                        allele frequencies; GP = genotype posterior
                        probabilities; GL = genotype likelihoods.
  --cores CORES         Number of cpu cores to use (default = 1).
