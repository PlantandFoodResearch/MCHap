  --haplotypes HAPLOTYPES
                        Tabix indexed VCF file containing haplotype/MNP/SNP
                        variants to be re-called among input samples.
  --prior-frequencies PRIOR_FREQUENCIES
                        Optionally specify an INFO field within the input VCF
                        file to designate as prior allele frequencies for the
                        input haplotypes. This can be any numerical field of
                        length 'R' and these values will automatically be
                        normalized.
  --filter-input-haplotypes FILTER_INPUT_HAPLOTYPES
                        Optionally filter input haplotypes using a string of
                        the form '<field><operator><value>' where <field> is a
                        numerical INFO field with length 'A' or 'R',
                        <operator> is one of =|>|<|>=|<=|!=, and <value> is a
                        numerical value.
  --bam BAM [BAM ...]   Bam file(s) to use in analysis. This may be (1) a list
                        of one or more bam filepaths, (2) a plain-text file
                        containing a single bam filepath on each line, (3) a
                        plain-text file containing a sample identifier and its
                        corresponding bam filepath on each line separated by a
                        tab. If options (1) or (2) are used then all samples
                        within each bam will be used within the analysis. If
                        option (3) is used then only the specified sample will
                        be extracted from each bam file and An error will be
                        raised if a sample is not found within its specified
                        bam file.
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Specify sample ploidy (default = 2).This may be (1) a
                        single integer used to specify the ploidy of all
                        samples or (2) a file containing a list of all samples
                        and their ploidy. If option (2) is used then each line
                        of the plaintext file must contain a single sample
                        identifier and the ploidy of that sample separated by
                        a tab.
  --inbreeding INBREEDING
                        Specify expected sample inbreeding coefficient
                        (default = 0.0).This may be (1) a single floating
                        point value in the interval [0, 1] used to specify the
                        inbreeding coefficient of all samples or (2) a file
                        containing a list of all samples and their inbreeding
                        coefficient. If option (2) is used then each line of
                        the plaintext file must contain a single sample
                        identifier and the inbreeding coefficient of that
                        sample separated by a tab.
  --sample-pool SAMPLE_POOL
                        A name used to pool all sample reads into a single
                        sample. WARNING: this is an experimental feature.
  --reference REFERENCE
                        Indexed fasta file containing the reference genome.
  --base-error-rate BASE_ERROR_RATE
                        Expected base error rate of read sequences (default =
                        0.0024). The default value comes from Pfeiffer et al
                        2018 and is a general estimate for Illumina short
                        reads.
  --use-base-phred-scores
                        Flag: use base phred-scores as a source of base error
                        rate. This will use the phred-encoded per base scores
                        in addition to the general error rate specified by the
                        --base-error-rate argument. Using this option can slow
                        down assembly speed.
  --mapping-quality MAPPING_QUALITY
                        Minimum mapping quality of reads used in assembly
                        (default = 20).
  --keep-duplicate-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as duplicates in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-qcfail-reads   Flag: Use reads marked as qcfail in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-supplementary-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as supplementary in the
                        assembly (these are skipped by default).
  --read-group-field READ_GROUP_FIELD
                        Read group field to use as sample id (default = "SM").
                        The chosen field determines tha sample ids required in
                        other input files e.g. the --sample-list argument.
  --report [REPORT ...]
                        Extra fields to report within the output VCF: AFPRIOR
                        = prior allele frequencies; AFP = posterior mean
                        allele frequencies; GP = genotype posterior
                        probabilities; GL = genotype likelihoods.
  --cores CORES         Number of cpu cores to use (default = 1).
  --mcmc-chains MCMC_CHAINS
                        Number of independent MCMC chains per assembly
                        (default = 2).
  --mcmc-steps MCMC_STEPS
                        Number of steps to simulate in each MCMC chain
                        (default = 2000).
  --mcmc-burn MCMC_BURN
                        Number of initial steps to discard from each MCMC
                        chain (default = 1000).
  --mcmc-seed MCMC_SEED
                        Random seed for MCMC (default = 42).
  --mcmc-chain-incongruence-threshold MCMC_CHAIN_INCONGRUENCE_THRESHOLD
                        Posterior phenotype probability threshold for
                        identification of incongruent posterior modes (default
                        = 0.60).
