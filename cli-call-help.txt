optional arguments:

  --haplotypes HAPLOTYPES
                        Tabix indexed VCF file containing haplotype/MNP/SNP
                        variants to be re-called among input samples.
  --haplotype-frequencies HAPLOTYPE_FREQUENCIES
                        Specify an INFO field within the input VCF file to use
                        for approximation of prior allele frequencies. This
                        can be any numerical field of length 'R' and these
                        values will automatically be normalized. This
                        parameter has no affect on the output but is necessary
                        for some other parameters.
  --skip-rare-haplotypes SKIP_RARE_HAPLOTYPES
                        Optionally ignore haplotypes from the input VCF file
                        if their frequency within that file is less than the
                        specified value. This requires that the --haplotype-
                        frequencies parameter is also specified.
  --bam [BAM ...]       A list of 0 or more bam files. All samples found
                        within the listed bam files will be genotypes unless
                        the --sample-list parameter is used.
  --bam-list BAM_LIST   A file containing a list of bam file paths (one per
                        line). This can optionally be used in place of or
                        combined with the --bam parameter.
  --sample-bam SAMPLE_BAM
                        A file containing a list of samples with bam file
                        paths. Each line of the file should be a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then a bam file path.
                        This can optionally be used in place the --bam and
                        --bam-list parameters. This is faster than using those
                        parameters when running many small jobs. An error will
                        be thrown if a sample is not found within its
                        specified bam file.
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Default ploidy for all samples (default = 2). This
                        value is used for all samples which are not specified
                        using the --sample-ploidy parameter
  --sample-ploidy SAMPLE_PLOIDY
                        A file containing a list of samples with a ploidy
                        value used to indicate where their ploidy differs from
                        the default value. Each line should contain a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then an integer
                        ploidy value.
  --inbreeding INBREEDING
                        Default inbreeding coefficient for all samples
                        (default = 0.0). This value is used for all samples
                        which are not specified using the --sample-inbreeding
                        parameter.
  --sample-inbreeding SAMPLE_INBREEDING
                        A file containing a list of samples with an inbreeding
                        coefficient used to indicate where their expected
                        inbreeding coefficient default value. Each line should
                        contain a sample identifier followed by a tab and then
                        a inbreeding coefficient value within the interval [0,
                        1].
  --sample-pool SAMPLE_POOL
                        A name used to pool all sample reads into a single
                        sample. WARNING: this is an experimental feature.
  --base-error-rate BASE_ERROR_RATE
                        Expected base error rate of read sequences (default =
                        0.0024). The default value comes from Pfeiffer et al
                        2018 and is a general estimate for Illumina short
                        reads.
  --use-base-phred-scores
                        Flag: use base phred-scores as a source of base error
                        rate. This will use the phred-encoded per base scores
                        in addition to the general error rate specified by the
                        --base-error-rate argument. Using this option can slow
                        down assembly speed.
  --mapping-quality MAPPING_QUALITY
                        Minimum mapping quality of reads used in assembly
                        (default = 20).
  --keep-duplicate-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as duplicates in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-qcfail-reads   Flag: Use reads marked as qcfail in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-supplementary-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as supplementary in the
                        assembly (these are skipped by default).
  --read-group-field READ_GROUP_FIELD
                        Read group field to use as sample id (default = "SM").
                        The chosen field determines tha sample ids required in
                        other input files e.g. the --sample-list argument.
  --report [REPORT ...]
                        Extra fields to report within the output VCF: GP =
                        genotype posterior probabilities; GL = genotype
                        likelihoods; AFP = posterior mean allele frequencies.
  --cores CORES         Number of cpu cores to use (default = 1).
  --mcmc-chains MCMC_CHAINS
                        Number of independent MCMC chains per assembly
                        (default = 2).
  --mcmc-steps MCMC_STEPS
                        Number of steps to simulate in each MCMC chain
                        (default = 2000).
  --mcmc-burn MCMC_BURN
                        Number of initial steps to discard from each MCMC
                        chain (default = 1000).
  --mcmc-seed MCMC_SEED
                        Random seed for MCMC (default = 42).
  --mcmc-chain-incongruence-threshold MCMC_CHAIN_INCONGRUENCE_THRESHOLD
                        Posterior phenotype probability threshold for
                        identification of incongruent posterior modes (default
                        = 0.60).
