optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --haplotypes HAPLOTYPES
                        Tabix indexed VCF file containing haplotype/MNP/SNP
                        variants to be re-called among input samples.
  --bam [BAM [BAM ...]]
                        A list of 0 or more bam files. All samples found
                        within the listed bam files will be genotypes unless
                        the --sample-list parameter is used.
  --bam-list BAM_LIST   A file containing a list of bam file paths (one per
                        line). This can optionally be used in place of or
                        combined with the --bam parameter.
  --sample-bam SAMPLE_BAM
                        A file containing a list of samples with bam file
                        paths. Each line of the file should be a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then a bam file path.
                        This can optionally be used in place the --bam and
                        --bam-list parameters. This is faster than using those
                        parameters when running many small jobs. An error will
                        be thrown if a sample is not found within its
                        specified bam file.
  --sample-list SAMPLE_LIST
                        Optionally specify a file containing a list of samples
                        to genotype (one sample id per line). This file also
                        specifies the sample order in the output. If not
                        specified, all samples in the input bam files will be
                        genotyped.
  --ploidy PLOIDY       Default ploidy for all samples (default = 2). This
                        value is used for all samples which are not specified
                        using the --sample-ploidy parameter
  --sample-ploidy SAMPLE_PLOIDY
                        A file containing a list of samples with a ploidy
                        value used to indicate where their ploidy differs from
                        the default value. Each line should contain a sample
                        identifier followed by a tab and then an integer
                        ploidy value.
  --inbreeding INBREEDING
                        Default inbreeding coefficient for all samples
                        (default = 0.0). This value is used for all samples
                        which are not specified using the --sample-inbreeding
                        parameter.
  --sample-inbreeding SAMPLE_INBREEDING
                        A file containing a list of samples with an inbreeding
                        coefficient used to indicate where their expected
                        inbreeding coefficient default value. Each line should
                        contain a sample identifier followed by a tab and then
                        a inbreeding coefficient value within the interval [0,
                        1].
  --base-error-rate BASE_ERROR_RATE
                        Expected base error rate of read sequences (default =
                        0.0). This is used in addition to base phred-scores by
                        default however base phred-scores can be ignored using
                        the --ignore-base-phred-scores flag.
  --ignore-base-phred-scores
                        Flag: Ignore base phred-scores as a source of base
                        error rate. This can improve MCMC speed by allowing
                        for greater de-duplication of reads however an error
                        rate > 0.0 must be specified with the --base-error-
                        rate argument.
  --mapping-quality MAPPING_QUALITY
                        Minimum mapping quality of reads used in assembly
                        (default = 20).
  --keep-duplicate-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as duplicates in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-qcfail-reads   Flag: Use reads marked as qcfail in the assembly
                        (these are skipped by default).
  --keep-supplementary-reads
                        Flag: Use reads marked as supplementary in the
                        assembly (these are skipped by default).
  --read-group-field READ_GROUP_FIELD
                        Read group field to use as sample id (default = "SM").
                        The chosen field determines tha sample ids required in
                        other input files e.g. the --sample-list argument.
  --genotype-likelihoods
                        Flag: Report genotype likelihoods in the GL VCF field.
  --genotype-posteriors
                        Flag: Report genotype posterior probabilities in the
                        GP VCF field.
  --cores CORES         Number of cpu cores to use (default = 1).
  --mcmc-chains MCMC_CHAINS
                        Number of independent MCMC chains per assembly
                        (default = 2).
  --mcmc-steps MCMC_STEPS
                        Number of steps to simulate in each MCMC chain
                        (default = 1500).
  --mcmc-burn MCMC_BURN
                        Number of initial steps to discard from each MCMC
                        chain (default = 500).
  --mcmc-seed MCMC_SEED
                        Random seed for MCMC (default = 42).
  --mcmc-chain-incongruence-threshold MCMC_CHAIN_INCONGRUENCE_THRESHOLD
                        Posterior phenotype probability threshold for
                        identification of incongruent posterior modes (default
                        = 0.60).
